# Project Enhancement Request: Bilingual Comparison Results

## Current Situation

The journal comparison application currently generates creative responses from the Gemini model in Indonesian language only. The output includes:

- Summary of each journal
- Explanation of main similarities and differences
- Analysis of the relationship between journals
- Conclusion about similarity level

## Problem Statement

Users need the ability to view comparison results in both Indonesian and English languages. Currently, the Gemini model only provides responses in Indonesian, limiting accessibility for international users.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a bilingual feature that allows users to:

1. Toggle between Indonesian and English results
2. View the same comparison analysis in both languages
3. Maintain consistency in analysis quality across both languages

## Technical Requirements

1. Modify the Gemini model prompt to generate responses in both languages
2. Update the UI to include a language toggle button
3. Store both language versions of the response
4. Ensure proper formatting and display for both languages

## Implementation Considerations

- The comparison logic and similarity scoring remain unchanged
- Only the creative response text needs to be bilingual
- User preference for language should be remembered (localStorage)
- Both language versions should be generated in a single API call to minimize costs

## Expected Outcome

Users will be able to seamlessly switch between Indonesian and English versions of the comparison results, making the application more accessible to a wider audience while maintaining the quality and accuracy of the analysis.

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Bilingual feature has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

### 1. Modified Gemini Model (`src/utils/model-gemini.js`)

- Updated system prompt to generate responses in both Indonesian and English
- Changed response format to JSON with `indonesian` and `english` keys
- Added robust JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Increased maxOutputTokens to 1000 to accommodate bilingual content

### 2. Created BilingualResultBox Component (`src/components/BilingualResultBox.jsx`)

- New React component with language toggle functionality
- Language preference stored in localStorage
- Flag icons for visual language identification
- Backward compatibility with string-based responses
- Error handling for missing language content

### 3. Updated FilePreview Component (`src/components/FilePreview.jsx`)

- Replaced ResultBox with BilingualResultBox
- Added proper import for the new bilingual component
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding language toggle

### Features Implemented:

- âœ… Toggle between Indonesian (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©) and English (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) results
- âœ… User language preference persistence via localStorage
- âœ… Single API call generates both language versions (cost-efficient)
- âœ… Backward compatibility with existing Indonesian-only responses
- âœ… Visual language indicators and proper error handling
- âœ… Responsive design with modern UI elements

The bilingual feature is now ready for use and provides seamless language switching for journal comparison results.
